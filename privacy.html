            <p>For the Daily Affirmations App, also known as "moodsky"</p>
            <p class="effective-date">Last Updated: October 1, 2025</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Daily Affirmations app. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information. Our philosophy is simple: <strong>your data is yours, and we believe it should stay on your device.</strong> This app is designed to be a private and personal space for you.</p>

            <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
            <p>We do not collect, store, track, or transmit any personal information or usage data from you. <strong>We do not have servers, databases, or analytics tools to track your activity.</strong> The app functions entirely offline, and your data never leaves your device.</p>

            <h2>2. Information You Provide and Where It Is Stored</h2>
            <p>Any information you enter into the app is stored locally on your own device using Apple's standard `UserDefaults` system. This data is for your use only and is never accessible to us or any third party. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Your Name:</strong> If you choose to enter your name in the Settings tab, it is used solely to personalize the greeting message within the app. It is stored only on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>Favorite Affirmations:</strong> The list of affirmations you mark as favorites is saved on your device so you can access it at any time.</li>
                <li><strong>App Preferences:</strong> Your choices for settings, such as the selected theme, daily streak visibility, haptic feedback, and notification preferences, are all saved locally on your device.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Information We Explicitly Do Not Collect</h2>
            <p>To be perfectly clear, we <strong>DO NOT</strong> collect any of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your email address, phone number, or any other contact information.</li>
                <li>Analytics data, such as how often you use the app or which features you interact with.</li>
                <li>Your device's unique identifiers (IDFA, etc.).</li>
                <li>Your location data.</li>
                <li>Any information from your contacts, photos, calendars, or other apps.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <p>All data generated by the app is stored in a private, sandboxed container on your device, which is standard for all iOS applications. This data is protected by your device's security features, such as your passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID. <strong>If you delete the app from your device, all of its associated data is permanently deleted as well.</strong></p>

            <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The Daily Affirmations app <strong>does not integrate with any third-party services</strong> for advertising, analytics, or data processing. The only external links in the app are those that direct you to our Support or Privacy Policy pages, which are opened in your device's web browser at your request.</p>
            
            <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us. Since we do not collect any data, we would have nothing to delete, but we are committed to protecting children's privacy.</p>

            <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

            <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
